                <h3 align=left id="what-is-call-for-code-">1. What is Call for Code?</h3>
                <p align=left>Call for Code asks innovators to create practical,
                    effective, and high-quality applications based on one or
                    more IBM Cloud™ services (for example, web, mobile, data,
                    analytics, AI, IoT, or weather) that can have an immediate
                    and lasting impact on humanitarian issues. Teams of
                    developers, data scientists, designers, business analysts,
                    subject matter experts and more are challenged to build
                    solutions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and climate
                    change. </p>
                <p align=left>This year the competition will have two tracks. One track is
                    for solutions that help halt and reverse the impact of
                    climate change. The second track is for solutions to
                    mitigate the impact of global pandemics like COVID-19 on
                    communities around the world. Winning solutions are
                    deployed in communities that need the most help.</p>

                    for Code India Virtual Hack?</h3>
                <p align=left>Every year as a part of the global challenge, we organize
                    regional hackathons for India where teams are mentored by
                    seasoned developer advocates from IBM. Similarly, this
                    event is a subsidiary of the global challenge. But as you
                    know with the recent increase in the number of cases for
                    COVID-19 and light of the measures declared by our
                    Government for a 21 days lockdown, we are taking the
                    challenge to your doorstep virtually.</p>
                <h3 align=left id="is-it-different-from-the-global-challenge-">3. Is it
                    different from the Global Challenge?</h3>
                <p align=left >No, it is a part of the global challenge.</p>
                <h3 align=left id="how-will-it-affect-my-chances-of-participation-in-the-global-challenge-">
                    4. How will it affect my chances of participation in the
                    global challenge?</h3>
                <p align=left >With the Call for Code India Hackathon, you will be able to
                    get in touch with developers who are at the heart of
                    technology every day, you will be able to refine and send
                    in a matured submission with an increased chance of getting
                    to the finish line.</p>
                <h3 align=left id="will-willing-the-india-challenge-guarantee-a-regional-win-for-the-global-challenge-">
                    5. Will willing the India challenge guarantee a regional win
                    for the Global Challenge?</h3>
                <p align=left>No. The India challenge though a subsidiary of the global
                    challenge, it does not affect or change your submission to
                    the global challenge.</p>

                    6. Will I need to do a separate submission to the global
                    challenge?</h3>
                <p align=left>As stated earlier, India challenge submissions will only be
                    considered for the Call for Code India Virtual Hack. You
                    will need to create a separate submission to the global
                    challenge as given in the portal. <a
